# 🪐 Hi, I'm Joye Yu
    
> Welcome to my blog.
 
**info:** I'm a programmer currently diving into Django development. I used to study the fucking materials engineering, but now I'm walking the path of code. This blog is where I record my technical growth, project experiences, and some thoughts from everyday life.

## 💻 What I'm doing now — OpenIELTS

- Developing an online IELTS examination system based on Django  
- Studying databases, automated testing, and REST API design

## ✨ Why I started this blog

Partly to document the mistakes I've made and lessons I've learned,  
Partly to build an "online résumé + knowledge tree" that reflects my skills.  
And hopefully, to connect with others who share similar passions 🤝
